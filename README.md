This paper adopts a quantitative approach, emphasizing data visualization to analyze growth trajectories across selected countries. Using R, the annual GDP per capita growth rates of a low-income, emerging, and advanced economy are plotted to highlight patterns and trends in economic performance. For a deeper analysis, India, as an emerging economy, is examined in distinct economic periods, including pre- and post-economic liberalization, global financial crises, pandemics, and other significant events. Average GDP growth during these periods is visualized to understand the countryâ€™s economic response to both domestic and global factors.
Additionally, the relationship between GDP growth and the selected macroeconomic variables is analyzed. Correlation matrices and scatterplots generated in R identify key variables that strongly influence growth. Visualization techniques are used throughout to provide clear and impactful understandings into growth patterns and their underlying drivers.
